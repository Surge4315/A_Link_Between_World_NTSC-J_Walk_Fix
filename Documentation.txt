A hack to make Link's directional movement closer match your input.

Based on i_hate_drm's Control Fix hack for European and American versions.

In ALBW, Link's directional movement is off by 5 degrees.

Pressing up will make him walk up, and slightly left.

This hack sets this adjustment factor to zero.

This hack is compatible with a .3ds Decrypted JPN ROM of A Link Between Worlds(Zelda no Densetsu - Kamigami no Triforce 2). 

You can apply this patch using Lunar IPS.
